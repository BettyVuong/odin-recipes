        <p>
            I've never been a big fan of banana bread but my boyfriend's absolute favourite dessert is this dish.
             Once I made this recipe, I understood as well, now I'm a big fan of this recipe as well. I'm happy to 
             share this with everyone as well.
        </p>
        <p>The recipe is quite simple, as always, have two bowls, one for dry and another for wet ingredients.
            Make sure that the bananas are ripe, the more ripe, the better! Also ensure that the butter is melted as well.
