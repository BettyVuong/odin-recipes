        <h1>Stuffed Peppers</h1>
        <img src="https://www.onceuponachef.com/images/2022/02/stuffed-peppers-01.jpg" alt = "A delicious stuffed peppers recipe!">
        <p>
            Stuffed peppers are a classic easy and filling dish I love to make as a university student who meal preps to save time! 
            The dish is so easy to make which is vital for people who don't want to revisit the grocery store after multiple failed 
            attempts. I tend to make the portion size which this recipe makes 6. Then, I freeze and refrigerate my portions.
             This is a great idea for reheating. I'd recommend not placing cheese until you're ready to reheat!

            The recipe consists of hollowed peppers which are filled with a stuffing of ground beef, tomato sauce
            , veggies, rice, and cheese. This dish has seasonings that are similar to a taco seasoning mix. I like
             to add spinach to mine as well for added greens!

                Roast the peppers for about 20 minutes, until slightly browned and tender-crisp. A bit of liquid will 
                accumulate in the bottom of the peppers; that's okay.

                Meanwhile, heat the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet. 
                Add the onion and cook, stirring frequently, until soft and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the garlic 
                and cook 1 minute more; do not brown. Add the ground beef mixture, chili powder, cumin, and oregano and 
                increase the heat to medium high. Cook, breaking the meat up with a wooden spoon, until the meat is 
                browned and almost cooked through, 4 to 5 minutes. Add the tomato sauce and bring to a boil; reduce 
                the heat to medium low and cook, uncovered, until the meat is cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the

                remaining ¾ cup cheese and place back in the oven. Roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until the filling is hot 
                and the cheese is melted and bubbling, and serve.
